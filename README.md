# latex-templates

In this repository you can find some of the templates i use for my documents.
If you are interested in learning about ```LaTeX``` I am writing a tutorial,
which you can also find [here](latex.md).

## academic-paper

[This](academic-paper/) template I have created for papers I have to write at
university. It uses the [APA](https://www.apa.org/) citation style, that my
universtities guidelines dictates us to use.

It requires the following packages (most should be installed by default in your
version of LaTeX):

- [apacite](https://ctan.org/pkg/apacite) to cite references in the APA-style
- [hyperref](https://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref) to create links with in the document
- [graphicx](https://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx) to include figures
